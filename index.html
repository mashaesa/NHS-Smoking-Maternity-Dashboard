    <h2>Report: Key Findings and Analysis</h2>
    <div class="report-text">
        <p><strong>Highest percentage of smokers in NHS Region Nottingham and Nottinghamshire (14.02%)</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>This could be due to socio-economic factors, such as lower income. There may also be limited access to the appropriate healthcare and advice for smoking cessation.</li>
            <li>To address this, we could increase funding and availability for anti-smoking programmes within this region.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>High Number of ‘Smoking Status Unknown’ in Devon</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The line chart comparison revealed that Devon reported 20% of cases where smoking status was unknown during maternity.</li>
            <li>Incomplete or inconsistent data collection and reporting practices could have caused this. There may also have been a lack of appropriate protocols for ensuring smoking status was accurately reported during healthcare visits.</li>
            <li>Expecting mothers may have been unwilling to share certain information.</li>
            <li>We could implement better training for healthcare staff to improve the data collection process. We could also introduce a non-judgemental approach in consultations to allow for more accurate data collection.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Regional Division Comparisons: North East and Yorkshire vs. London</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The regional division comparison recorded that the North East and Yorkshire had the highest percentage of smokers during maternity, whilst London had the lowest overall percentage.</li>
            <li>Potential reasons could include lower incomes and limited access to smoking cessation resources compared to London. There may also be cultural factors that influence smoking rates between the two areas. London may have greater funding and therefore access to healthcare resources, education, and public health campaigns targeting smoking.</li>
            <li>We can expand public health campaigns in the North East and Yorkshire area and prioritise low-income families in particular.</li>
            <li>We could also conduct a case study on the North West area of London specifically to identify successful strategies and adapt them to higher-risk areas.</li>
            <li>Develop a nationwide strategy to reduce smoking during maternity, focusing particularly on higher-risk areas such as Nottinghamshire, the North East, and Yorkshire.</li>
        </ul>
